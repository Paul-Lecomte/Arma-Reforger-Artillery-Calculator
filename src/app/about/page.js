                    <p>
                        Start by selecting your map. The tool supports multiple military-style maps with different grid systems. Each map has its own specific conversion factor for accurate calculations. Youâ€™ll need to know the grid scale to make sure the artillery calculations are precise.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Selecting Your Faction</h3>
                    <p>
                        Choose between <strong>US</strong> and <strong>RU</strong> artillery. Each faction has unique data, including different artillery systems, ranges, and charge configurations.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Choosing Your Shell</h3>
                    <p>
                        After selecting the faction, choose the type of artillery round you want to use: <strong>HE</strong> (High Explosive), <strong>Smoke</strong>, <strong>Illumination</strong>. Each shell type has its own properties, such as range and dispersion.

                    <h3>Firing Position</h3>
                    <p>
                        The firing position refers to the location where your artillery will be stationed <strong style={{color: "red"}}>Red circle</strong>. Drag the marker of your firing position <strong style={{color: "green"}}>Green circle</strong>,
                        or select it directly on the map. The tool will use this position to calculate the distance to the target.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Target Area</h3>
                    <p>
                        Next, choose where you want your artillery to hit. You can select a target point on the interactive map. The tool will calculate the angle (azimuth), the rings needed on the shell and elevation necessary to hit the target accurately.

                    <h3>Results Display</h3>
                    <p>
                        Once the firing position and target area are set, the tool will calculate and display the necessary settings for firing the artillery. This includes the required azimuth, elevation, and charge settings. The results will also be shown on the map with range circles and other visual aids.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The results tab makes it easy to know exactly what adjustments you need to make to fire your artillery accurately, saving time and effort during gameplay.
